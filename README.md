# TLD_SleepWithoutABed

A mod for The Long Dark that allows players to sleep without a bed or bedroll. Accessed through the "Pass Time" option in the radial menu.

Mod Features:

Fatigue Recovery Penalties
- Reduce the amount of fatigue recovered while sleeping with no bed or bedroll.

Cold Exposure Effects: 
- Sleeping or passing time without a bed or bedroll causes players to freeze faster and lose additional health when freezing or suffering from hypothermia. The severity of these effects scales with temperature, becoming harsher as conditions worsen.

Health Recovery Adjustment:
- Health is restored similarly to using a bed but at an adjusted rate (adjustable setting).

Low health sleep interruption:
- Interrupts sleep or passing time if health goes below the threshold (adjustable setting), giving a chance of survival. Can also be applied to real beds/bedrolls (enabled by default).
