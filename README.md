# TLD_SleepWithoutABed

A mod for The Long Dark that allows players to sleep without a bed or bedroll. Accessed through the "Pass Time" option in the radial menu.

- Fatigue Recovery Penalties:
Players can choose one of the following penalties for fatigue recovery while sleeping without a bed/bedroll:

   - Full fatigue recovery (TLD Default)
   - 3/4 fatigue recovery
   - 1/2 fatigue recovery
   - 1/4 fatigue recovery
   - 1/8 fatigue recovery

New Features: v2.0.0

 - Cold Exposure Effects: 
Sleeping or passing time without a bed/bedroll causes players to freeze faster and lose additional health when freezing or suffering from     hypothermia. The severity of these effects scales with temperature, becoming harsher as conditions worsen.

 - Health Recovery Adjustment:
Fixed a major issue from the previous version where sleeping without a bed/bedroll did not restore health. Now, health is restored similarly to using a bed but at a reduced rate.

Requirements:
- [The Long Dark](https://www.thelongdark.com/) (v2.35)
- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.6.6) (v0.6.6)
- [ModSettings](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/ModSettings/releases/)
