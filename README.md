# TLD_SleepWithoutABed

A mod for The Long Dark that allows players to sleep without a bed or bedroll. Accessed through the "Pass Time" option in the radial menu.

v2.2.0
- Changed the way the player sleeps without a bed. The mod no longer relies on a nonexistent(null) bed; instead, it creates a temporary low-condition clone of a bedroll that is destroyed after use.
- Added a setting to control the probability that a predator will interrupt sleep with an attack.
- Added settings to further control how temperature affects cold exposure penalties.(Optional/Experimental).

- Bug fix: Condition recovery no longer occurs if the player is dehydrated or starving.

- It seems that predator attacks during rest are bugged. Sometimes the camera will act strangely or break keeping the screen black (faded out) throughout a struggle.

Mod Features:

Fatigue Recovery Penalties
- Reduce the amount of fatigue recovered while sleeping with no bed.

Cold Exposure Effects: 
- Sleeping or passing time without a bed/bedroll causes players to freeze faster and lose additional health when freezing or suffering from hypothermia. The severity of these effects scales with temperature, becoming harsher as conditions worsen.

Health Recovery Adjustment:
- Health is restored similarly to using a bed but at an adjusted rate.

Low health sleep interruption:
- Interrupts sleep/passing time if health goes below the adjustable setting, giving a chance of survival. Also applied to real beds/bedrolls(optional.
